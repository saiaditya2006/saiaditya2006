### 🚀 Featured Projects
#### 🔹 **LLM Chatbot with Pushover Alerts**
Chatbot using OpenAI + Pushover + Gradio.  
Sends real-time mobile notifications for responses.  
Made because I wanted my bot to disturb me more than my professors.

#### 🔹 **EEG → ML Pipeline for Schizophrenia Detection**
Trying CNN, VGG, and graph-based models.  
Goal: improve early diagnosis using EEG signals.  
Still training models… and my patience.

#### 🔹 **Pharma Data Insights (Neuland Labs Internship)**
Working with real-world datasets  
— building scripts, dashboards, and small ML ideas.

### 😄 A Little More About Me
- I break my code on Monday  
- I fix it on Friday  
- And I commit everything on Sunday so it looks like I worked the whole week.
